- Clone the project.
- Run ``./tools init-containers`` to build and start all the containers.

if you need an empty Symfony 5 Project:

- Run ``./tools init-symfony-project symfony/skeleton:"7.1.*"`` to initialize the Symfony 7 project.
- Add ``0.0.0.0 project.local`` to ``/etc/hosts``.

That's it!
